### Vim/Nvim
As someone who started using Vim before Neovim was an option I still love Vim and use it on my servers and
I think that it better suits the 'Unix spirit' and forever will be my goto when choosing a single tool,
that said on my PC I do use Neovim as my main text editor because it is faster and grows way faster + it made some choices which I think are better (Lua for example)
